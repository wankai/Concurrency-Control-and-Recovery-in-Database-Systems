4.2 TIMESTAMP ORDERING (TO)
-----------------

#### Introduction

In timestamp ordering, the TM assigns a unique timestamp, ts(Ti), to each transaction Ti. It generates timestamps using any 
of the techniques of described in Section 3.11, in the context of timestamp-based deadlock prevention. the TM attaches a 
transaction's timestamp to each operation issued by the transaction. It will therefore be convenient to speak of the timestamp 
of operation oi(x), which is simply the timestamp of the transaction that issued the operations. A TO scheduler orders 
conflicting operations according to their timestamps. More precisely, in enforces the rule, called the TO rule.
