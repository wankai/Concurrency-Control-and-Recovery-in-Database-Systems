Concurrency control is the activity of coordinating the actions of processes that operate in parallel, 
access shared data, and therefore potentially interfere with each other. Recovery is the activity of ensuring
that software and hardware failures do not corrupt persistent data. Concurrency control and recovery problem
arise in the design of hardware, operating systems, real time systems, communications system, and database 
systems, among others. In this book, We will explore concurrency control and recovery problems in database systems.
