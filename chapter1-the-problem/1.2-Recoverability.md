1.2 RECOVERABILITY
---------

The recovery system should make the DBS behave as if the database contains all of the effects of committed transactions and 
none of the effects of uncommitted ones. If transactions never abort, recovery is rather easy. Since all transactions 
eventually commit, the DBS simply executes database operations as they arrives. So to understand recovery, one must first 
look at the processing of Abort.
