1.2 RECOVERABILITY
---------

The recovery system should make the DBS behave as if the database contains all of the effects of committed transactions and 
none of the effects of uncommitted ones. If transactions never abort, recovery is rather easy. Since all transactions 
eventually commit, the DBS simply executes database operations as they arrives. So to understand recovery, one must first 
look at the processing of Aborts.

When a transaction aborts, the DBS must wipe out its effects. The effects of a transaction T are of two kinds: effects on 
data, that is, values that T wrote in the database; and effects on other transactions, namely, transactions that read values 
written by T. Both should be obliterated.
